## Specification Deliverable
### Elevator Pitch
There are a few non-profit organizations that serve LGBTQ+ and allied members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but none that are run by and focus specifically on transgender individuals. Jershon seeks to be a group that can support transgender latter-day saints by providing an online space with resources and frequent zoom meetings. The goal is to help these individuals find their place of refuge within the Church, especially in the wake of the August 2024 updates to the General Handbook of the Church that have harmful implications for transgender members.

- **CSS** - I will use CSS to create professional-looking styling for the organization.
- **React** - JavaScript and React will help the website work together coherently and display videos and events.
